    <p>
 At this stage you are able to observe the contributions of your group members
 and send them 'deduction tokens'. Each deduction token decreases your payoff
 by 1 point, and decreases the other member's payoff by {{Constants.punishment_factor|c}}.
 </p>
 <p>You can't send more than {{Constants.punishment_limit|c}} to each member. </p>
